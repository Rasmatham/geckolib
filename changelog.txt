- Added `getTriggeredAnimation` to AnimationController
- Added stop triggered animation functionality to all geo animatables
- Change crashes to warnings for unsupported model format versions for geo models
- Add support for rotated face UVs

- Fixed entity velocity being determined mostly from x-coordinate velocity
- Added GeoRenderer context to GeoModel getters for context-specific handling
