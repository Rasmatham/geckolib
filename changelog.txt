v4.7.1

- Added native support for catmull-rom (smooth) easings for bedrock-style animation jsons (Thanks for the initial work Zigy)
- Default boneResetTime to 5-ticks, and auto-complete the reset if the tick time is 0. This prevents unavoidable partial-tick bone resets
- Removed the deprecation markers on the model/texture getters in GeoModel
- Reorient bone visibility a bit to support mods that modify part visibility prior to rendering
- Fix zero-time reset of bones not being zero-time
- Introduced an identity-based lookup for synced singleton animatables, to hopefully eliminate class-duplication collisions
- Synced animatable items no longer prevent stacking with each other
- Fixed middle-clicking on synced animatable items causing them to conflict when using triggered animations or synced data (#681)
- Bones that use animations to do a full rotation should now no longer counter-rotate when resetting, allowing for cleaner rotation animations
- Added `stopTriggeredAnimation` to `SingletonGeoAnimatable`
- Added triggerArmorAnim for triggering armor animations (#433)
- Cleaned up the javadoc for EasingType
- Animated textures now support glowmasks (#456)
- Add `query.controller_speed` Molang query
